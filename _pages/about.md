I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the [Department of Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.ncat.edu/cost/departments/mathematics/index.php) at North Carolina A&T State University (NCA&T). 

I received my PhD and MS degrees in Statistics from Oklahoma State University in 2016 and 2014, respectively. Prior to joining NCA&T, I worked as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.indiana.edu) at Indiana University and served as a statistical consultant at the [Indiana Statistical Consulting Center](https://iscc.indiana.edu).

I completed my BS in Statistics in 2010 from the School of Economics & Political Science at [Cairo University](https://cu.edu.eg/Home), Egypt, where I was then employed as a teaching assistant for two years before moving to the United States in 2012. 

__My research interests__ lie in the areas of _survey design and analysis_, _nonparametric statistics_, _data blending/data integration_, _statistical learning_ and _statistics & data science education_.

In my current position, I teach both upper- and lower-level statistics and data science courses, conduct both methodological statistics research and applied research in collaboration with colleagues from various disciplines, and direct the Statistical Computing Lab.
